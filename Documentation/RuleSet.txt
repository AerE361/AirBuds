Rule Set

Pointer light moves around the board at constant speed by default.

One button changes direction of motion.

The other button changes the color of the led that the pointer is on.
 Maybe have a list of unlocked colors to cycle through?

The board starts all Black by default

The game is won when all the colors are on the board at the same time.
